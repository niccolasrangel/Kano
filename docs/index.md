# Introduction

Kano is a terminal for macOS, Windows and Linux built for working with coding agents. You run Claude Code, Codex, a dev server or a test watcher in its own **session**. Kano groups sessions by project in a sidebar that shows which are working, which need you and which are done.

## Sessions that outlive the window

Sessions don't run inside the app. They run in **kanod**, a small daemon that Kano starts for you. Quit Kano and everything keeps running. Open it again and every session, pane and scrollback is where you left it.

::: tip
Quitting Kano (<kbd>⌘</kbd> <kbd>Q</kbd>) leaves your sessions running. To end them all, use **Kano › Quit and End All Sessions…** (<kbd>⌘</kbd> <kbd>⌥</kbd> <kbd>Q</kbd>).

## Built for agents

- **Status at a glance.** Each pane is *working*, *waiting*, *idle*, *error* or *exited*. A session that needs you rises to the top of your attention, and <kbd>⌘</kbd> <kbd>J</kbd> jumps straight to it.
- **Notifications when it matters.** Kano notifies you when an agent finishes, fails or is blocked on you while you're looking elsewhere.
- **A CLI agents can drive.** The `kano` command starts sessions, splits panes, types into them, waits for them and reads their screens. Agents can run work beside themselves and report their own progress.
- **Ghostty under the hood.** Terminals render with libghostty, so Ghostty themes, fonts and configuration keys behave the way you expect.
